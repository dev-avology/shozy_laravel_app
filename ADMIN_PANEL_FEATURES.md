# Admin Panel Features

## User Management System

The admin panel now includes a comprehensive user management system with the following features:

### Role System
- **Customer (ID: 1)**: Regular customers who can place orders
- **Technician (ID: 2)**: Service technicians who can handle orders
- **Delivery (ID: 3)**: Delivery personnel who can deliver orders
- **Vendor (ID: 4)**: Vendors who can supply products

- **View all users** with their role names, contact information, and status
- **Search functionality** by name, email, or phone number
- **Filter by role** using the role dropdown
